            <h1>Cutthroat Flies</h1>
            <p>The fly patterns you choose will vary depending on the species of cutthroat, time of year, and your
                personal preference. Generally speaking, in the warmer months flies will be hatching, bringing a lot of
                attention and activity to the surface of the water, making it the perfect time to throw a dry fly. That
                being said, regardless of the time of year, unless there is an active hatch going on, trout generally do
                70% of their eating below the surface of the water. Again, this is an estimation, but a good rule of
                thumb is even when trout are eating off the surface, they're also eating below. Wet flies historically
                catch more fish than dry flies, but this will ultimatley come down to the angler.</p>
